TO DO:

* Move reset functionality out of reset button method into it's own class, and tidy up
	* reset camera and reset controller methods
* re-arrange pimmsTcpClient class to allow a single object to be created and re-used in main code for all functions
* cycle through a limited pool of source ports rather than incrementing indefinitely (will eventually break)
* allow dynamic scaling of number of trains (at start time, as defined in settings)
* add error handling
* add TCP (or other) server to allow commands from Stream Server
	* may be easier to write separate app for production use and keep GUI completely separate?
